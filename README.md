# 2048Clone

I got addicted to the popular game 2048, which involves sliding numbered tiles around a grid, combining them into powers of 2.
I decided a slightly more productive method of time wasting would be to make the game myself from scratch. I finished it in a few hours one day, using javascript and HTML canvas.
